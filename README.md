# KCF-React-video-library-project

## Project Overview
KCF-React Video Library is a platform where users can view movies from various movie categories/genres and then add, view, update and remove movies in a shopping cart. For a user to view available movies in the library, they should have created an account on the platform and should be logged in
Required Features
( This should not limit your creativity, feel free to make additions)
1. Users should be able to create an account via a Signup form.
2. Users with accounts should be able to log in via a Login form
3. Data entered into the signup and login form input fields should be validated. (Check if the input values are added and are correct. etc)
4. Movies displayed should have a cover image, a short description, a price tag, and a rating. Data should be fetched from a public API like https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/. For attributes like Price tag which might be provided by the API, please auto-generate the price for each movie.
 
5. Users should be able to add, view, update or remove movies in a shopping cart. The total price of movies added to the cart is displayed. (You donâ€™t need to implement the checkout/payment step for a product added to the cart - we shall implement this in the future)
6. Users should be able to search for a particular movie(s) using the movie title or movie genre.
7. Only logged-in users are eligible to view available movies in the Library.
